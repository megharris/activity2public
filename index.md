	I am a CPA (certified public accountant) and Accounting Instructor at 
	UNO. I currently teach introductory and intermediate managerial accounting 
	as well as Accounting Information Systems. Previously, I worked as a CPA in
	a variety of areas including tax, audit, public, private, retail, financial
	services, non-profit, energy, etc. My goal is to obtain a PhD in Information
	Technology/MIS and a tenure track position in the School of Accounting. 
	Additionally, I have two children and a third on the way.

	For fun, our family is into drag racing. My husband races a Chevy Cobalt 
	and we are up for a championship this year! Drag racing is sometimes confused with 
	Nascar but in Nascar, the racers drive in circles whereas drag racing is on a straight
	track and is much shorter. The cars use a lot of power and the sport overall requires a
	lot of strategic preparation.
